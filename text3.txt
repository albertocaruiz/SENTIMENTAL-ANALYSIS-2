Best sushi in Warsaw, not only for vegans! Exceptional flavors and delicious miso soup with a hint of lemon flavor - the best I've  tasted in my life. They even have tamari sauce, which made me very happy, since I am gluten-free.. It's very pleasant to look at the contemplation of the sushi Masters while they create their artful dishes, a very cool vibe overall. I'm waiting eagerly for brown rice. Prices adequate to the quality of food.fuck this shit is stupid. hate. i hate you fucking lemon!
